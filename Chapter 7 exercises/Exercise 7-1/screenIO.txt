WRITING'S ON THE WALL
SAM SMITH
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE
BUT ALWAYS HIT THE FLOOR
I'VE SPENT A LIFETIME RUNNING
AND I ALWAYS GET AWAY
BUT WITH YOU I'M FEELING SOMETHING
THAT MAKES ME WANT TO STAY
I'M PREPARED FOR THIS
I NEVER SHOOT TO MISS
BUT I FEEL LIKE A STORM IS COMING
IF I'M GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY
THEN THERE'S NO MORE USE IN RUNNING
THIS IS SOMETHING I GOTTA FACE
IF I RISK IT ALL
COULD YOU BREAK MY FALL?
HOW DO I LIVE? HOW DO I BREATHE?
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE I'M SUFFOCATING
I WANT TO FEEL LOVE, RUN THROUGH MY BLOOD
TELL ME IS THIS WHERE I GIVE IT ALL UP?
FOR YOU I HAVE TO RISK IT ALL
'CAUSE THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
A MILLION SHARDS OF GLASS
THAT HAUNT ME FROM MY PAST
AS THE STARS BEGIN TO GATHER
AND THE LIGHT BEGINS TO FADE
WHEN ALL HOPE BEGINS TO SHATTER
KNOW THAT I WON'T BE AFRAID
IF I RISK IT ALL
COULD YOU BREAK MY FALL?
HOW DO I LIVE? HOW DO I BREATHE?
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE I'M SUFFOCATING
I WANT TO FEEL LOVE, RUN THROUGH MY BLOOD
TELL ME IS THIS WHERE I GIVE IT ALL UP?
FOR YOU I HAVE TO RISK IT ALL
'CAUSE THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
HOW DO I LIVE? HOW DO I BREATHE?
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE I'M SUFFOCATING
I WANT TO FEEL LOVE, RUN THROUGH MY BLOOD
TELL ME IS THIS WHERE I GIVE IT ALL UP?
HOW DO I LIVE? HOW DO I BREATHE?
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE I'M SUFFOCATING
I WANT TO FEEL LOVE, RUN THROUGH MY BLOOD
TELL ME IS THIS WHERE I GIVE IT ALL UP?
FOR YOU I HAVE TO RISK IT ALL
'CAUSE THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
